[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/tulsarb/suggestotron.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/tulsarb/suggestotron)

The point of this repository is a technology demonstration and playground. This is the suggestotron sample application built during a [RailsBridge](http://railsbridge.org). Feel free to create an account and play with the [hosted app](https://suggestotron.railsbridgetulsa.org).

**I have added some features like:**

* Devise - authentication
* RSpec - testing
* AWS ElasticBeanstalk - hosting
* AWS SQS - background processing 
* AWS SNS - email notifications
* Sentry.io - error reporting
* CircleCI - continuous integration
* HoundCI - code style checks
* Skylight.io - app montoring
