# Suggestotron

The point of this repository is a technology demonstration and playground. This is the suggestotron sample application built during a [RailsBridge](http://railsbridge.org). Feel free to create an account and play with the [hosted app](https://suggestotron.railsbridgetulsa.org).

**I have added some features like:**

* Devise authentication
* AWS ElasticBeanstalk Hosted
* Background Processing with AWS SQS
* Email notifications on votes
* Error reporting to Sentry.io
* RSpec testing
* CircleCI
