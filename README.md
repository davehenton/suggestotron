The point of this repository is a technology demonstration and playground. This is the [suggestotron](http://docs.railsbridge.org/intro-to-rails/) sample application built during a [RailsBridge](http://railsbridge.org). Feel free to create an account and play with the [hosted app](https://suggestotron.railsbridgetulsa.org).

You can see a demo version of this app at [suggestotron.railsbridgetulsa.org](https://suggestotron.railsbridgetulsa.org).
